## Team project
[Repository Scanning Tool](https://jvanderzouwen.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-NoIdea): The Repository Scanning Tool aims to help individual developers and teams by incorporate a single software tool to complete a more thorough code analysis of one or many project code repositories.  The tool enables individual developers to install many static code analysis tools through one Powershell script.  At this point, the individual developer just needs to run the scanning tool against one or many repositories at a time to obtain all static code analysis feedback.  The developer can then take the feedback and resolve all issues or at least know what all of issues are instead of needing to run multiple static code analysis tools against every code repository individually.
